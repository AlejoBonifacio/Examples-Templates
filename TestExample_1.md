This test card is used to validate ideas and working hypotheses consistently in 4 steps: 1) Hypothesis 2) Experiment 3) Metric 4) Criterion

## 1. Hypothesis: We believe what
A hand powered centrifuge can deliver enough relative centrifugal force to separate samples of fluids in the context of AIDS, meningitis or other disease diagnosis.

## 2. Experiment: To verify it we will do
Use existing mechanisms for to create rotational force, power it with the and and mount samples on this rotational mecahnism.

__You can even provide drawings concepts, and more specific details of the experiment etc__
### Materials needed:
- Tacometer to measure speed
### Tasks
- Find similar solutions
- Explore different rotational mechanisms

## 3. Metric: and we will measure the following indicators
Time, RPM, target RCF 2000g, 

## 4. Criteria: We have partially validated the idea if
The standard RCF used in the context of analysis for specific types of diseases is met.
Particularly
